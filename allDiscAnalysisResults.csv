Q1 Eri. ALMA data from \cite{Lovell2021} \#UPDATE CITE WHEN PUBLISHED. Asymmetry seen in HST and ALMA - most-distant ALMA point on opposite side of star to most-distant HST point. Sharp inner edge implied sculpting by planet. Modelled as symmetric disc with clump by \citet{Lovell2021}, possibly material trapped in resonance with unseen planet, but also shown in that paper that an alternative scenario with an eccentric planet with a*e = 2-3.4 au could instead drive the eccentricities of the disc inner and outer edges to those observed. For consistency with the rest of this paper, we assume asymmetry is driven by an eccentric planet. Note that our values of $q_{\rm o}$ and $Q_{\rm o}$ are reversed from those measured in \cite{Lovell2021}, because our method requires ${q_{\rm o} \leq Q_{\rm o}}$, however, since these measured values are consistent with each other, the effect on our calculations is small. There is also a known planet at 2.03 au, with M sin(i)= 0.93 mJup and eccentricity 0.2 \citep{Butler2006, Marmier2013}, but this is too far inwards to sculpt or stir disc \textit{in situ} \#CHECK. Could have sculpted disc then migrated inwards? \#CHECK Gaspar will examine with NIRcam (announced at AAS 2020). Herschel model on sdb. Age 1600 Myr, but could be 300-7000 Myr (refs in \citealt{Holland2017})."

Known ${0.66^{+0.12}_{-0.09} \mJup}$ planet much closer in at ${3.52\pm0.04 \au}$, which may be significantly inclined relative to the disc \citep{LlopSayson2021}. \cite{Quillen2002} predict a planet sculpting disc through resonances with eccentricity 0.3, semimajor axis 40 au, mass 0.1 mJup, but fitted to old 1998 SCUBA data, so may not be valid. Check literature and compare to our predictions. Herschel model on sdb. Inner belt present, possibly resolved (refs in \citealt{Booth2017}). \cite{Booth2017} show that a single sculpting planet would be exterior to ${45\au}$, and that observations rule out masses greater than ${1.3\mJup}$. Our results are consistent with this \#CHECK. They also show that a single planet at ${48\au}$ could be in 3:2 resonance with the inner edge and 2:1 resonance with the outer edge, and the sharpness of these edges is consistent with this hypothesis. \#READ \cite{Booth2017}.

REASONS. Gap at $73\au$ \citep{Marino2019}. Gap at $73\au$ \citep{Marino2019}, and small asymmetries seen (possibly due to background galaxy). If the gap is carved by an \textit{in situ} planet, then \cite{Marino2019} argue that that planet has mass ${<0.6\mJup}$. Alternatively, if the gap is created through a secular interaction with planets near the disc inner edge (e.g. \citealt{Pearce2015HD107146, Yelverton2018, Sefilian2021}), then the outermost planet would have a semimajor axis of ${40-45\au}$ and mass of at least ${10\mEarth}$ (${0.03\mJup}$). Note our planet constraints are for the disc inner and outer edges, rather than the gap. However, if the gap is created through a secular interaction with an eccentric planet near the disc inner edge (e.g. \citealt{Pearce2015HD107146, Yelverton2018, Sefilian2021}) then that planet would need a mass of at least ${10\mEarth}$ (${0.03\mJup}$) \#CHECK to carve the gap (i.e. for 10 secular times to have ellapsed within the system age). Therefore, our results show that a single planet both stirs the disc and truncates its inner edge, then that planet would be massive enough to also carve the gap through a secular interation. Herschel model on sdb. More detailed notes in \citet{Holland2017}. Age ${200 \myr}$, range ${100-300\myr}$ (refs in \citealt{Holland2017})."

REASONS. Gap at ${80\au}$ \citep{Ricci2015, Marino2018}. Note our planet constraints are for the disc inner and outer edges, rather than the gap. \cite{Marino2018} argue that the gap could be carved by multiple ${10\mEarth}$ (${0.03\mJup}$) planets \textit{in situ}  (although that model is inconsistent, because they model the disc as massless but such planets would rapidly migrate in a ${300\mEarth}$ disc). Equation \ref{eq: pltMassToStir} shows that such planets would also be able to stir the disc outer edge within the system lifetime even with small eccentricities. Alternatively, if the gap is created through a secular interaction with an eccentric planet near the disc inner edge (e.g. \citealt{Pearce2015HD107146, Yelverton2018, Sefilian2021}) then that planet would need a mass of at least ${10\mEarth}$ (${0.04\mJup}$) \#CHECK to carve the gap (i.e. for 10 secular times to have elapsed within the system age). Such a planet would be unable to stir the whole disc, unless it previously migrated through it (as in \citealt{Pearce2015HD107146}. Herschel model on sdb. More detailed notes in \citet{Holland2017}.

HR 8799. ALMA data from \cite{Faramaz2021}, using their Model 3 for the inner and outer edge locations. This has a smoothly rising inner edge and smoothly falling outer edge, with a peak between, as expected from a disk that contains a high eccentricity component. Disc emission therefore extends both inwards and especially outwards of the radii we use, so both our truncating and stirring planet masses may be underestimates. Note her Fig. 3 shows the best fitting model (r1 at 129 au), whilst we use her median value of 172 au (I asked Virgine). 4 giant planets \citep{Marois2008, Marois2010}. From dynamical arguments, \cite{Wang2018} predict planets all have semimajor axes between between 15 and ${70 \au}$, and masses ${6-7 \mJup}$, we take outermost at ${70.8 \au}$ with mass ${5.8 \mJup}$. No strong evidence for planet-disc misalignment, but ${10^\circ}$ misalignment cannot be excluded \citep{Faramaz2021}.

Fomalhaut C. ALMA data from \cite{CroninColtsmann2021}. Narrow. Disc modelled with offset circles, corresponding to possible eccentricity (${0.04^{+0.03}_{-0.02}}$, with upper limit of 0.14). Like ${\HD202628}$, we take inner edge peri as {rIn(1-e) (rIn is the radius of the offset circle fitted to the inner edge), and apo as rIn(1+e). Outer edge done likewise. However, like ${\HD202628}$ this means ${Q_{\rm i} > q_{\rm o}}$, so cannot use standard assumptions to get disc width for \cite{Krivov2018} self-stirring. Instead use radii of inner and outer circles as innermost and outermost semimajor axes (shown to yield the correct width and central semimajor axis). Note Table 1 of \cite{CroninColtsmann2021} lists values as arcmin, but actually arcsec - checked with Grant. \cite{CroninColtsmann2021} argue that, if narrow ring edges are 2:1 and 3:2 resonances with planet (like Neptune and Kuiper Belt), then planet would lie at ${17-20\au}$. Consistent with our prediction that a single planet sculpting the disc would have minimum mass ${0.060 \pm 0.008\mJup}$ and have semimajor axis ${\leq 21.7^{+0.5}_{-0.6} \au}$ \#CHECK. Herschel data on sdb, but no model (undetected at ${70\um}$, unresolved at ${100\um}$?). Part of the Fomalhaut wide triple system. 440 MYR, M4V . Ralf says binary, check."
